*** Original field s***

BRL_spot_FX_rate: Brazillian real per 1 US dollar exchange rate

Current_account: Current account as a % of GDP

Trade_balance: Trade balance in million US dollars

Implied_rate: Local interest rate implied from 3-month FX forward contract

REER: Real effective exchange rate 

MOV_AVG_200D: 200-day moving average

MOV_AVG_50D: 50-day moving average


Steps:

1. Impute by duplication with historical data for all feature fields daily to match the spot FX rate
2. Create lagged features
3. Create derived features
4. Create dataframe with columns of equal length, i.e. remove older rows if other features don't have data for those dates


*** Lagged features ***

For Short-Term Model:
5-day lag for Current_account
5-day lag for Trade_balance
5-day lag for Implied_rate
5-day lag for REER
5-day lag for MOV_AVG_200D
5-day lag for MOV_AVG_5D

For Long-Term Model:
21-day lag for Current_account
21-day lag for Trade_balance
21-day lag for Implied_rate
21-day lag for REER
21-day lag for MOV_AVG_200D
21-day lag for MOV_AVG_5D


*** Derived target variable (also in EM_FX_data.xlsx) ***

BRL_1m_return=BRL_spot_FX_rate from 21 previous days ago/current BRL_spot_FX_rate - 1 
*this will be the target variable for Long-Term Model(timing of entry into trading position)

BRL_5d_return=BRL_spot_FX_rate from 5 previous days ago/current BRL_spot_FX_rate - 1 
*this will be the target variable for Short-Term Model(security selection)


*** Derived features (also in EM_FX_data.xlsx) ***

3m_change_in_TB=(current Trade_balance - Trade_balance from 3 months ago)/Trade_balance from 3 months ago

6m_change_in_TB=(current Trade_balance - Trade_balance from 6 months ago)/Trade_balance from 3 months ago

5yr_REER_discount=(current REER - average REER for previous 5 years)/average REER for previous 5 years

Momentum:
1 if MOV_AVG_50D<MOV_AVG_200D
0 otherwise
